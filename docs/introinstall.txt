Direct Python Audio/Video is a library wrapping certain functionalities of Pygame that aims to give users a very simple, no-nonsense, direct feeling experience with basic audio and video manipulation. This library features the ability to craft basic waveforms and play them, as well as manipulate pixels in an image using 24-bit hex color codes, using no more than a few calls from our library. We abstract away technical aspects of interfacing with audio and video devices such as the need to maintain an event loop, in favor of straightforward calls that feel intuitive and beginner friendly.

Installation
This library may be installed by cloning the repository with commands such as
